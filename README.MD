# An example Vaadin Portlet

This is an example Vaadin Portlet built for Liferay+Vaadin Webinar in May 2014. It uses the user database in Liferay and user Vaadin UI to update it.

Essentials in this demo:

 * The new "self-contained packaging". Vaadin libraries and generated resources are in portlets wars. This packanging method makes most task simpler, e.g. one can start to update Vaadin 6 portlets to Vaadin 7 - one by one.
 * The example uses the upcoming Valo theme. To be officially released in 7.3. This, even with its basic settings, fit better for the new theme in latest Liferay  versions.
